# VBC Bundled Treatment Platform (Open Source)

Open-source technical foundation for building **Value-Based Care (VBC)** bundled payment engines using normalized **medical claims** and **pharmacy claims**. The platform includes a versioned episode catalog, deterministic and explainable episode assignment, weighted overlap allocation (one claim split across multiple episodes), API/CLI execution paths, and analytics outputs suitable for contracting, actuarial review, and care management operations.

This repository is designed as a serious starter for organizations implementing episode-based payment models (for example, BPCI-like bundles, specialty episode programs, payer-provider risk arrangements, and internal cost-accounting bundles).

## Clinical and Business Context

In bundled payment models, a clinically-related set of services across a pre-defined care window (for example, index hospitalization + post-acute follow-up) is grouped into an **episode of care**. Financial accountability requires:

- A robust mapping between raw claim activity and episode definitions.
- Support for medical and pharmacy cost integration.
- Explainable assignment and adjudication logic.
- Allocation policy when a single claim is relevant to multiple conditions/bundles.

This platform provides those core technical primitives while remaining implementation-neutral so payers, providers, MSOs, ACOs, TPAs, and analytics vendors can adapt it to local policy.

## Core Capabilities

- **Normalized claims domain model**
  - Eligibility, members, providers, medical headers/lines/diagnoses, and pharmacy fills.
  - SQL schema in `vbc` namespace for reproducible local/CI deployment.
- **Episode catalog model**
  - Episode metadata, rule catalog, code sets, and temporal windows.
  - Supports ICD-10-CM/PCS context (diagnosis matching), CPT/HCPCS (professional/facility procedures), and NDC (drug exposures).
- **Deterministic assignment engine**
  - `INDEX` rules create anchor events.
  - `INCLUSION`/`EXCLUSION` rules refine assignment.
  - Multi-episode membership is native.
- **Weighted overlap allocation**
  - Claim overlap is split across matched bundles using rule-derived scoring.
  - Stores `allocation_weight`, `allocation_pct`, and allocated dollar fields per assignment.
- **Reporting and quality**
  - PMPM and risk outputs preserved.
  - Bundle reporting includes gross vs allocated spend and overlap diagnostics.
  - Reconciliation checks for operational monitoring.
- **Execution surfaces**
  - CLI orchestration for local runs.
  - FastAPI service endpoints for integration into enterprise systems.

## Data Model Highlights

Primary tables (see also `docs/data_dictionary.md`):

- **Medical claims**
  - `vbc.claim_header`, `vbc.claim_line`, `vbc.diagnosis`
- **Pharmacy claims**
  - `vbc.rx_claim_header`, `vbc.rx_claim_line`
- **Episode catalog**
  - `vbc.episode_definition`
  - `vbc.episode_rule` (`rule_role`, `code_system`, `match_operator`, `rule_weight`, `specificity_score`)
  - `vbc.episode_rule_window`
  - `vbc.code_set`, `vbc.code_set_member`
- **Assignment outputs**
  - `vbc.member_episode_instance`
  - `vbc.claim_episode_assignment`
  - `vbc.allocation_run`

### Weighted Split Logic (Technical)

When a claim matches multiple episode instances, the engine computes a per-match score:

`score = rule_weight * specificity_score * (1 + 1/rule_order)`

Then for each unique claim key (`medical_claim_id` or `rx_line_id`):

`allocation_pct_i = score_i / sum(score_all_matches_for_claim)`

Allocated amounts are persisted:

- `allocated_allowed_amount = base_allowed * allocation_pct`
- `allocated_paid_amount = base_paid * allocation_pct`

This produces deterministic, auditable, and financially reconcilable overlap handling.

## Quickstart (Local)

```bash
docker compose up -d
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -U pip
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Initialize schema
vbc-claims init-db

# Generate synthetic normalized medical+pharmacy sample files
vbc-claims generate-sample --rows 20000

# End-to-end pipeline: load claims + load episode catalog + build member months + assign episodes + reconciliation
vbc-claims run-pipeline --data-dir ./data/synthetic --bundled-dir ./data/sample/bundled

# Operational outputs
vbc-claims report --month 2025-12
vbc-claims report-bundles --month 2025-12
```

Alternative:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/run_bundled_pipeline.sh
./scripts/run_bundled_pipeline.sh
```

## API Service

Start service:

```bash
vbc-claims-api
```

Or via compose (`api` service included in `docker-compose.yml`).

Key endpoints:

- `GET /health`
- `GET /episodes/catalog`
- `POST /episodes/assign/run`
- `GET /episodes/assignments`
- `GET /reports/bundles?month=YYYY-MM`

Use `/docs` for interactive OpenAPI (Swagger UI).

CI runs PostgreSQL service and enables integration mode with `RUN_INTEGRATION=1`.

## Productionization Guidance

Recommended hardening for enterprise use:

- Version-lock episode catalogs with formal release governance.
- Implement validation contracts for inbound claim feeds (schema, domain, and conformance checks).
- Add policy modules for payer/program-specific overlap allocation and precedence.
- Add reconciliation packs for:
  - institutional vs professional claim balance checks,
  - pharmacy rebate adjustment extensions,
  - episode-level financial conservation assertions.
- Add deployment artifacts for Kubernetes, ingress policy, and workload identity.
- Add RBAC and auditing for catalog/rule changes and assignment reruns.
